1.	Please read the honour code and type your name below by ignoring Turkish characters.

2.	While there may be a lot of reading to do on a problem, there is relatively little code to write, so please take the time to read each problem and **the hints** carefully. The longest problems are the easiest in this exam.

3. Please make sure that your code runs and does what you expect it to do before submitting. You can use the test cases we provide but you should also come up with additional test cases of your own. This is the only benefit of having an online exam. 

4. If you see **an empty repl** when you accept the assignment, first refreh the page. If that does not work, then delete the repl and accept the assignment again. If it still does not work, raise your hand virtually and we will be there to help you.

5. There is a solution file in each question for your solutions. Even if you work on a solution in `main.py` or some other temp file, please do not forget to copy your code and answers to allocated areas in `Q[1-3].py` files.

6. Note that any function or code fragment that you write will be judged not only on correct functionality, but also on clarity and good programming practice.

7. Please mute yourselves. Talking, messaging, sharing screen are not allowed. 

8.	No questions to the TAs! Please raise your hand virtually and you will be directed to a breakout room with the instructor.

9. There are 3 questions in the exam. You will have (45x3 + 15x2) minutes in the exam, meaning 45 minutes for each question and 15 minutes break in between questions. 

10. You will receive an email from us with the link to accept the assignment at the beginning of an hour, i.e. at 12:00, 13:00, and 14:00. Please check your email when we notify you on zoom and start working on the question. Do not forget to commit and push your repl before the deadline, i.e. at 12:45, 13:45, and 14:45. It is your responsibility to commit **before the deadline**. Late commits will not be accepted.

11. If the commit&push button on repl.it does not work, then first download your work, then delete the repl, accept the assignment again, copy your work into the new repl, and try to do the commit&push. If that does not work, raise your hand virtually, we will be there to help you.


Good luck!
